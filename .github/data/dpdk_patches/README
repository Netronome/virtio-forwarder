This directory would normally be empty (or close to empty). In some
cases however it makes sense to apply patches to the DPDK codebase
before compiling virtio-forwarder

Patches included in the directory should be in the "git am" format. If
a specific order is desired patches should be numbered accordingly:

0001-first-patch-to-be-applied.patch
0002-second-patch-to-be-applied.patch
